a young couple only married
a few years and I'm sure you will
like them
Honey my exams scedule is  
definite now. I finish on tuesday
morning Jan 26, and I Do have
an exam on Feb 3 in the afternoon.
Darling if you could come out by or
before the 26th I thought we might
be able to go to N.J. We could leave
here at 12 in the afternoon and have
at least 6 days home. It won't be enough
time to go to Chicago as much and
I'd like to go but since we can't
I'd like to go home so we could
help mom make some final arrangements
about the wedding. Mom has prices
for the linens and gift show in N.Y.
which is from the 26 Th & the 29th
