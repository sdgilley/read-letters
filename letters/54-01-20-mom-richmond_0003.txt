3,
we could get our linens there
wholesale. The furniture Mart Show
will probably be in NY then and
we could get back here by The 3rd
and stay over night. I could register
early in the morning on the 4th
and then we could go back to
Princeton. I'll be able to stay
there till Sunday night with you.
That is if these plans are
alright with you and everyone
concerned and if Manny is back
& doesn't have to go to Morgantown.
Darling as soon as you can
come in do so. I had a wonderful
suprise last night and won't
have any studying for my art
history exam . The exam I took
in it last week was the final
as far as the history past of it
