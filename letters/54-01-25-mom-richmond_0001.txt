Saturday night
Dearest Calvin,
Darling please excuse the paper + pencil.
but I'm at aund Jo's and she is asloeep and
I can't find anything else. I was so glad you
called tonight. Darling I'm so very lonesome
here I miss you so much. I cant wait
until we could be together. IT seems like
ages since I last saw you and seem like
the day for us to be together will never come.
I just keep hoping and praying that this
snow will melt by Monday so you can drive
in. If you can't darling I don't know
what to do. I want to be with you but too
we do have te decide on some furniture
etc and I guess I should go home to help
mom with plans for the wedding
I just don't know what to do I guess
I'm make more of it then there is
