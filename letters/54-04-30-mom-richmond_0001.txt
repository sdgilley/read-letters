Thursday night
Dearest Calvin,
Darling, It was so good to talk.
to you tonight only you sounded so
many ??. Nothing is wrong is it.
Darling I love you very much. I
miss you terribly. I do so hope
we can be together next week end.
Or the following week end for sure.
I want to to be with you.
I went down town this morning
shopping and got mom and dad
a table cloth and napkin set. I know
mom has wanted another one for
sometime. It's may ??. I just
didn't know what to send them and
when I found this set I was thrilled
with it. I'm sure they will like it.
I sent it from both of us. I didn't
stay long because my tooth was
bothering the devil out of me.
I came back and went to the dentist
