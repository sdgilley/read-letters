but with so little time to get things together
because of my school work, I'm in kind
of a dither myself. Honey, I guess I'm
really getting confusing and sounding
confusing to you now too so I'l drop
the whole matter. What ever happens.
will be for the best anyways.
Darling I love you, I love you
very much and only want to be with you
Nothing else seems to matter at all. I think
if I have to wait much longer before I can
see you I'm going to say the heck with
it all and start walking to Princeton. Honey
I can't help it I'm lonesome, I miss you
I want to be with you that's all I ask .
Is that too much to ask?
Looks like I'm running out of
paper so I'll have to close now.
All my love my darling forever -
Sandy
