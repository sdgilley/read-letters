He took x-rays of my jaw which
is now about twice the size of
the one on the other side of
my face. He said from the
way it looks both the top and
lower wisdom teeth are coming

on it. Preferably the heat. I'm to see
him tomorrow if that doesn't help other

doesn't want to cut this out unless it
is absolutely necessary. I should
know by Tues. Honey I'm afraid if
you see me now you would
